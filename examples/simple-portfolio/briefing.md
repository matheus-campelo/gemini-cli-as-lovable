### **Part 3: Brand & Visual Identity**

*   **3.1. Existing Assets:** I have a simple text-based logo (PNG file). No formal brand guide, color palette, or fonts.

*   **3.2. Look & Feel:** "Minimalist, elegant, visual, modern". The focus should be entirely on the photos.

*   **3.3. Design Inspiration (Likes):** 
    *   `https://www.stefan-schnell.com/` - I love the full-screen images, the immersive feel, and the extremely simple navigation.
    *   `https://www.francescocollinaphoto.com/` - The grid layout on the portfolio is effective, and the site feels very professional.

*   **3.4. Design Inspiration (Dislikes):** Any site that feels cluttered, has small images, or uses too many distracting colors. The photo should be the hero.
