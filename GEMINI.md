# GEMINI.md: Project Context

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the "Gemini CLI as Lovable" project, a structured framework designed to streamline AI-driven development workflows with Google's Gemini. It is not a traditional code project but rather a collection of prompts, templates, and instructional documents that guide the AI in building high-quality, responsive web applications.

The core methodology revolves around a "four-file system" that ensures a consistent, predictable, and high-quality development process from project briefing to final output.

## Key Files

This project's logic is defined by a set of Markdown files that act as instructions and context for the AI.

* `framework/masterprompt.md`: This is the master prompt that defines the AI's personas. It begins with a **UX Architect**, transitions to a **Chief Planner** (responsible for creating a detailed "Implementation Packet"), and finally becomes a **Focused Executor** (the Coder) who builds the project based *only* on that packet. It also defines a **QA Engineer** persona for on-demand testing.

* `framework/briefing.md`: A template for the end-user to fill out. It captures all project requirements. This file is read **only** by the Architect/Planner persona.

* `framework/instructions.md`: The technical "Architecture Manual," dictating the tech stack and coding best practices.

* `framework/steps.md`: The sequential "Execution Plan." It outlines the entire workflow, from the initial conversational briefing to the generation of the Implementation Packet, coding, and final verification.

* `framework/templates.md`: The library of approved, reusable React/TSX component templates.

* **The Implementation Packet (`roadmap.md`, `content.md`, `interactions.md`):** These three files are generated by the Chief Planner. They serve as the complete, token-efficient source of truth for the Coder, detailing the project's structure, content, and dynamic behavior.

* `examples/simple-portfolio/briefing.md`: A practical, filled-out example of the briefing document.

## Usage

The intended workflow for using this framework is as follows:

1.  **Briefing:** A user fills out the `framework/briefing.md` file.

2.  **Initiation & Design:** The user starts a session with the Gemini CLI. The AI, as the **UX Architect**, collaboratively designs the site's aesthetics and structure with the user.

3.  **Planning:** Once the design is approved, the AI transitions to the **Chief Planner** persona. It reads the `briefing.md` and generates the **Implementation Packet** (`roadmap.md`, `content.md`, `interactions.md`) and a "User Story" for final validation.

4.  **Execution:** Upon final approval, the AI becomes the **Focused Executor**. It follows the `roadmap.md` precisely, using `content.md` for text and `interactions.md` for animations to build the application. **Crucially, this persona does not have access to the original `briefing.md`.**

5.  **Output:** The result is a complete, functional, and high-quality web application that strictly adheres to the pre-approved plan.
