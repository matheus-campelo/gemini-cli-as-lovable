# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-14



### Added



- **Component-as-Code Model:** Decoupled components from templates by creating a component library in `framework/components`. This makes the framework more modular, scalable, and less prone to errors.

- **Theme-as-Data Model:** Automated the design system by using CSS variables and a theme template. This ensures that the generated website perfectly matches the user's brand identity.

- **Visual Regression Testing:** Enhanced the final verification with visual testing using Playwright. This ensures that the application's UI has not changed unexpectedly.
