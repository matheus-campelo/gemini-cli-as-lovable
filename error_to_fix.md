# Development Log and Troubleshooting

This document outlines the challenges faced during the development of the clinic website, the solutions implemented, and the problems that remain unsolved.

## Solved Problems

### 1. Dependency Conflicts (`ERESOLVE` errors)

**Problem:** The initial `npm install` commands failed with `ERESOLVE` errors. This was due to conflicting peer dependencies between the packages, especially between the version of React installed by Vite and the versions expected by the `shadcn/ui` components.

**Solution:** The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag was used with `npm install`. This flag tells npm to ignore the peer dependency conflicts and proceed with the installation. This was a successful workaround to get the project dependencies installed.

### 2. `shadcn/ui` CLI issues

**Problem:** The `shadcn/ui` CLI was not working as expected. The `init` command was failing, and the `add` command was also failing with dependency-related errors. The CLI was also interactive, which made it difficult to use in an automated environment.

**Solution:** A temporary project was created to isolate the `shadcn/ui` installation process. In this temporary project, the `shadcn/ui` components were added one by one, and the source code for each component was copied to the main project. This was a tedious but effective workaround to get the `shadcn/ui` components into the project.

### 3. `tailwindcss-animate` not found

**Problem:** The build process failed with an error indicating that the `tailwindcss-animate` module could not be found.

**Solution:** The `tailwindcss-animate` package was installed using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps tailwindcss-animate`. This resolved the build error.

## Unsolved Problems

### 1. `AnimatedSection` component

**Problem:** The `AnimatedSection` component, which was intended to provide scroll animations using `framer-motion`, was causing build errors. The errors were related to TypeScript types and the way the `framer-motion` library was being used.

**Attempts to fix:**
- The `useRef` hook was updated to use a more specific type.
- The props were spread to the `motion.section` component.
- The component was temporarily removed to allow the rest of the project to be built.

**Current Status:** The `AnimatedSection` component is not included in the final build. The website is functional and visually complete, but it lacks the scroll animations.

## Suggested Next Steps

- **Revisit `AnimatedSection`:** A fresh attempt to fix the `AnimatedSection` component could be made. This might involve:
    - Creating a minimal reproduction of the component in a separate project to isolate the issue.
    - Consulting the `framer-motion` documentation for the correct usage with Vite and TypeScript.
    - Trying a different approach to the component, such as using a different animation library or a simpler implementation.
- **Manual dependency management:** Given the issues with the `shadcn/ui` CLI, a more manual approach to dependency management might be necessary for future updates or component additions.
