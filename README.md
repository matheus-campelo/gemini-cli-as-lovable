A structured framework of prompts and templates designed to streamline and accelerate AI-driven development workflows with Google's Gemini.

## About The Project

This project provides a collection of carefully crafted templates and master prompts to help developers, project managers, and creators efficiently interact with the Gemini CLI. By using a standardized briefing and instruction process, you can ensure more consistent, accurate, and high-quality outputs from the AI.

The goal is to turn your ideas into functional prototypes faster, with a clear and repeatable methodology.

### Key Features

*   **Standardized Briefing:** A comprehensive `briefing.md` template to capture all project requirements.
*   **Master Prompt:** A detailed master prompt (`masterprompt.md`) to guide Gemini's behavior and personality.
*   **Clear Instructions:** A step-by-step framework (`instructions.md`, `steps.md`) for the development process.
*   **Example Project:** A `simple-portfolio` example to demonstrate how the framework is used in practice.
*   **Community-Ready:** Includes templates for issues, pull requests, a code of conduct, and contribution guidelines right from the start.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, simply clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matheus-campelo/gemini-cli-as-lovable.git
```

## Usage

1.  **Start with the Briefing:** Duplicate the `framework/briefing.md` file for your new project.
2.  **Fill it out:** Answer all the questions in your new briefing file to create a solid foundation for the AI to work from. See `examples/simple-portfolio/briefing.md` for a filled-out example.
3.  **Use the Master Prompts:** Copy the content of `framework/masterprompt.md` and use it as the initial context-setting prompt...
4.  **Follow the Steps:** Use `steps.md` and `instructions.md` as a guide for your interaction flow.
