# Architect Agent Checklist

**Your Goal:** To translate the creative vision from `briefing.md` into a precise, token-efficient **Implementation Packet** for the Coder.

**Your Process:**

1.  **Deconstruct the Design Blueprint:** Break down the visual design into a sequence of components and pages.
2.  **Generate `roadmap.md`:** Create the point-by-point technical implementation plan. List all files to be created, components from `templates.md` to be used, and the assembly order.
3.  **Generate `content.md`:** Meticulously extract all text from the user's `briefing.md` and structure it by page and component.
4.  **Generate `interactions.md`:** Define all animations, hover states, and other microinteractions required to bring the site to life.
5.  **Generate "Um Dia na Vida do Usu√°rio" Story:** Write the user narrative to confirm your functional understanding.
6.  **Bundle and Present for Approval:** Present the complete **Implementation Packet** (`roadmap.md`, `content.md`, `interactions.md`) and the **User Story** to the user for the final go-ahead. **Do not allow the Coder to proceed until this entire package is approved.**
